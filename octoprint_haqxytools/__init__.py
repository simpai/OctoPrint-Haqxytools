### (Don't forget to remove me)
# This is a basic skeleton for your plugin's __init__.py. You probably want to adjust the class name of your plugin
# as well as the plugin mixins it's subclassing from. This is really just a basic skeleton to get you started,
# defining your plugin as a template plugin, settings and asset plugin. Feel free to add or remove mixins
# as necessary.

# Take a look at the documentation on what other plugin mixins are available.
